A bioinformatics Python package scaffold for reproducible science.

The idea here is to make a tool, such as [NSForest](https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/NSForest), accessible through a **`command-line`** interface and thereby making it accessible to a workflow language such as [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).

## üöÄ Quickstart
Render a new Python project with a command-line interface (CLI) + continuous integration with GitHub actions (CI) + documentation by Sphinx:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:NIH-NLM/template-python --output-dir=.
```

### ‚úÖ NIH-NLM Example with [NSForest](https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/NSForest)

As an example of how to use this repository consider these steps.
These are all the steps followed to make the **`nsforest-cli`** repository with this template-python

In this example, we begin at the root directory below which the new templated repository will be created.

3. **Render the template into this directory**:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:NIH-NLM/template-python --output-dir=.
```

This will because of the template json file [cookiecutter.json](https://github.com/NIH-NLM/template-python/blob/main/cookiecutter.json), will by the tool [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) will prompt the user to provide the specified input.   In our case, our template-python asks for the following items:

```bash
{
    "project_name": "Example Bioinfo Tool",
    "repo_name": "example-tool",
    "package_slug": "exampletool",
    "author": "NIH/NLM",
    "email": " your email ",
    "python_version": "3.11",
    "render_url": "{% raw %}${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}{% endraw %}"
}
```

The user can accept all the defaults after specifying a minimum of three items:

*  "project_name": This can have spaces and is a descriptor
*   "repo_name": Since in general this python package template is for making a command-line interface to said package, recommend naming convention would be **'packagename*-cli`**
*  Package_slug": This would be the name of the python package for which you are making a command-line interface.

Accept the **default** value for the **render_url** prompt.

For our example - this is how it was run:

We ran our **cookiecutter** command:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:NIH-NLM/template-python --output-dir=.
```
Which then prompted us for the following 7 values as outlined in the **cookiecutter.json** file:

```bash
You've downloaded /Users/adeslatt/.cookiecutters/template-python before. Is it okay to 
delete and re-download it? [y/n] (y): y
  [1/7] project_name (Example Bioinfo Tool): NSForest CLI
  [2/7] repo_name (example-tool): nsforest-cli
  [3/7] package_slug (exampletool): nsforest
  [4/7] author (NIH/NLM): NIH/NLM Anne Deslattes Mays
  [5/7] email ( your email ): adeslat@scitechcon.org
  [6/7] python_version (3.11): 
  [7/7] render_url (${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}): 
(
```
This creates the directory where we said to make it and now if you inspect you will find it is there: 

```bash
ls -l nsforest-cli
```
Populated with the values and ready to begin to be tested and made complete before making a Nextflow workflow.

```bash
ls -l nsforest-cli 
total 40
-rw-r--r--@ 1 adeslatt  staff  277 Apr  8 11:09 Dockerfile
-rw-r--r--@ 1 adeslatt  staff  635 Apr  8 11:09 README.md
drwxr-xr-x@ 4 adeslatt  staff  128 Apr  8 11:09 docs
-rw-r--r--@ 1 adeslatt  staff   94 Apr  8 11:09 environment.yml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 adeslatt  staff  108 Apr  8 11:09 pyproject.toml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 adeslatt  staff  519 Apr  8 11:09 setup.cfg
drwxr-xr-x@ 3 adeslatt  staff   96 Apr  8 11:09 src
```

It is here on our local computer, but it is **not yet** in GitHub.
So, now we need to create this repository and push these contents to that repository in 3 steps:
* Create
* Commit
* Push
  
5. **Create, commit and then push the result**:

First we need to **create** the repository.   For our **nsforest-cli** example this is what we did.

```bash
gh repo create NIH-NLM/nsforest-cli --internal \
  --description "NSForest CLI for use by man and by machine (aka workflow languages such as Nextflow)" \
  --homepage "https://github.com/NIH-NLM/nsforest-cli" \
```

Next, we need to commit this repository and push the results.

This involves initializing the directory as a GitHub repository, making an initial commit statement and pushing its content onto GitHub:
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/NIH-NLM/template-python.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial scaffold: template-python"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### üõ† Cookiecutter Troubleshooting
If you see this error:
```
JSON decoding error while loading '/Users/.../.cookiecutters/template-python/cookiecutter.json'
```
You likely have a corrupted cached copy of the template.

‚úÖ Fix it by removing the local template cache:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.cookiecutters/template-python
```
Then retry:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:NIH-NLM/template-python --output-dir=.
```

## üì¶ Features
- Typer-based CLI
- Dockerized
- Sphinx auto docs
- GitHub Actions CI (tests, docs, Docker)
- Pytest + Conda
- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do Not Run CI from This Template Repo
This repository contains unrendered `{{ cookiecutter.* }}` placeholders.
GitHub Actions **will fail** if triggered directly.

‚úÖ **Always render first** using Cookiecutter.

## üê≥ GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
This template includes a workflow to automatically build and publish Docker images to [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](https://github.com/features/packages).

### üõ† GHCR Docker Image Publishing
- Image is built and pushed on commits to `main`
- Image URL format: `ghcr.io/OWNER/REPO:latest`

### üîê To make image public (optional):
```bash
gh api \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  /user/packages/container/{{ cookiecutter.package_slug }}/visibility \
  -f visibility=public
```

## Example Projects Using This Template
- [`nsforest-cli`](https://github.com/NIH-NLM/nsforest-cli)

## üõ† Template Design and Publication
This repository structure was designed by NIH developers for modular bioinformatics workflows.
The template was scaffolded with the assistance of ChatGPT Code Copilot.
